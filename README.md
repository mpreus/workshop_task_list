# workshop_task_list
JavaScript used to help a user remembering important tasks. 
Internet site with an input element to write down you tasks for the day (week / month). 
The site creates a list of your tasks with options to mark each particular task as done. If you change your mind, you can restore the task to the list. Each task can be also removed from the list. Additionally, all tasks marked as done can be removed collectively. 
There is assumption that the task description should be longer than 5 characters and shorter than 99 ones. If the text exeeds these limits, pop-up alert (SweetAlert2 library added) appears to warn the user.
